you must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to the frenchman
holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising
this unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me of a pleasure
and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leave your
enchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovna

his daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightly
holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturous
almost frightened eyes as she passed him

very lovely said prince andrew

very said pierre

in passing prince vasili seized pierres hand and said to anna pavlovna
educate this bear for me he has been staying with me a whole month and
this is the first time i have seen him in society nothing is so
necessary for a young man as the society of clever women

anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew his
father to be a connection of prince vasilis the elderly lady who had
been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasili
in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumed had
left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and
fear

how about my son boris prince said she hurrying after him into the
anteroom i cant remain any longer in petersburg tell me what news i
may take back to my poor boy

although prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the
elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an
ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go
away

what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he would
be transferred to the guards at once said she

believe me princess i am ready to do all i can answered prince
vasili but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i should advise
you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that would be the
best way

the elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya belonging to one of the
best families in russia but she was poor and having long been out of
society had lost her former influential connections she had now come to
petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son it
was in fact solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained an
invitation to anna pavlovnas reception and had sat listening to the
vicomtes story prince vasilis words frightened her an embittered
look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then she
smiled again and clutched prince vasilis arm more tightly

listen to me prince said she i have never yet asked you for
anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of my
fathers friendship for you but now i entreat you for gods sake to do
this for my sonand i shall always regard you as a benefactor she
added hurriedly no dont be angry but promise i have asked golitsyn
and he has refused be the kindhearted man you always were she said
trying to smile though tears were in her eyes

papa we shall be late said princess helene turning her beautiful
head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood
waiting by the door

influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized
if it is to last prince vasili knew this and having once realized that
if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unable
to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence but in
princess drubetskayas case he felt after her second appeal something
like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite true
he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career
moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those women
mostly motherswho having once made up their minds will not rest
until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on
insisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenes
this last consideration moved him

my dear anna mikhaylovna said he with his usual familiarity and
weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask
but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your fathers memory
i will do the impossibleyour son shall be transferred to the guards
here is my hand on it are you satisfied

my dear benefactor this is what i expected from youi knew your
kindness he turned to go

waitjust a word when he has been transferred to the guards she
faltered you are on good terms with michael ilarionovich kutuzov
recommend boris to him as adjutant then i shall be at rest and
then

prince vasili smiled

no i wont promise that you dont know how kutuzov is pestered since
his appointment as commander in chief he told me himself that all the
moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants

no but do promise i wont let you go my dear benefactor
